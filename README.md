# Blackcoffer-App Data Visualization Dashboard

This project is a Data Visualization Dashboard built using Spring Boot for the backend and React Native for the frontend.

## Features

- Displays data fetched from a MongoDB database using Spring Boot APIs.
- Allows users to interact with the data through filters and controls.
- Visualizes data using interactive charts and visuals.
- Supports cross-platform usage with React Native for mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Spring Boot, MongoDB, Java
- **Frontend**: React Native, JavaScript, Axios
- **Data Visualization**: D3.js, Chart.js, Plotly.js (depending on preference)
- **Others**: Node.js, npm, Expo CLI (for React Native development)
